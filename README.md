# README

This repository includes all the necessary files to understand the use of YAO and P-REx in my work. 

In order to get the necessary outputs I slightly changed the yao.i file used by YAO. This file can just be exchanges if one wants the outputs of the AO system (such as DM voltages, WFS slopes, etc.). The included jupyter notebook file shows a short example of how one can use my prex python module to reconstruct the piston over a telescope. The necessary data is, in this case, produced by a YAO simulation.
